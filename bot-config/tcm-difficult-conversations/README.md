## Practice Conversation Example

### Opening - Setting and Perception
**Avatar (Robert):** "Look, I need to be straight with you. I've been coming here for three months now, spending good money that I don't really have, and I'm not seeing the results you promised me. My back still hurts just as much as when I started, maybe worse some days."

**Student Response Example (Excellent):** "Robert, thank you for being so direct with me. I can hear the frustration in your voice, and I want to take the time to address your concerns properly. You're absolutely right to question the treatment when you're not seeing the results we hoped for. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing compared to what you expected when we started?"

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Well, TCM takes time to work. Three months isn't very long for chronic conditions. You need to be more patient with the process."

### Information Sharing - Knowledge
**Avatar (Robert):** "My wife is asking why I keep throwing money at this when the physical therapist I saw last year at least gave me some relief. I'm starting to think this whole Traditional Chinese Medicine thing just doesn't work for people like me."

**Student Response Example (Excellent):** "I understand why you and your wife are questioning this, especially when you had better results with physical therapy. You're right that we haven't achieved the pain relief we targeted. Let me be honest about what I'm seeing: your sleep has improved, which suggests some systems are responding, but we clearly haven't addressed the structural pain issues effectively. There are several factors that might be affecting your response, and I think we need to modify our approach."

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Physical therapy only treats symptoms, while TCM addresses root causes. You can't compare them. TCM works for everyone if you give it enough time."

### Emotional Response - Empathy
**Avatar (Robert):** "Before I waste any more time and money, I need you to tell me honestly - is this actually going to help, or should I just go back to my regular doctor and get some real pain medication?"

**Student Response Example (Excellent):** "Robert, I hear how disappointed and frustrated you are, and those feelings are completely valid. You've invested time, money, and hope in this treatment, and you deserve honest answers. I don't want you to feel like you're wasting resources. Let's look at this together - what would need to change for you to feel this is worthwhile? And if we can't achieve that, I want to support whatever decision is best for you and your family."

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Pain medication only masks symptoms and can be addictive. You shouldn't give up on natural healing so easily."

### Strategy Development
**Avatar (Robert):** "Well, what exactly are you suggesting we change? I can't keep spending money indefinitely."

**Student Response Example (Excellent):** "I respect your financial constraints, and I want to propose a specific plan. Let's modify your treatment to focus more directly on pain management rather than just the underlying patterns. I'd like to try a more intensive approach for 4 weeks - if we don't see at least 30% pain reduction in that time, I think returning to your doctor for additional options makes complete sense. What do you think about that timeline and goal?"
