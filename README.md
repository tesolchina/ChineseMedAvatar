# Chinese Medicine Avatar Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive Chinese medicine avatar using proprietary technology for educational and consultation purposes.

## September 2025 Goals
Based on the meeting with Kaitai Zhang on 2025-08-22, the priority objectives for September include:

### Core Features to Implement
- **Animated Photo Avatar**: Set up an animated photo that can talk and interact
- **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Implement cost-effective TTS with low API costs
- **Speech-to-Text Engine**: Implement cost-effective STT with low API costs  
- **Turn-Based Control**: Button interface to control conversation turns
- **Multi-Avatar Support**: Enable multiple people to talk with multiple avatars

## Current Test Environment
- **Test URL**: http://8.211.158.223/
