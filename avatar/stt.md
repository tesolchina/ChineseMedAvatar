# Speech-to-Text Module

## Overview
Cost-effective speech-to-text engine for real-time conversation with the Chinese Medicine Avatar.

## Requirements
- Low API costs
- High accuracy Chinese language recognition
- Real-time processing
- Noise reduction capabilities

## Potential Services
1. **Azure Cognitive Services Speech** - Good pricing and Chinese support
2. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** - Strong accuracy for Chinese
3. **Amazon Transcribe** - Pay-per-use model
4. **Local STT Solutions** - Whisper, DeepSpeech for cost savings

## API Interface
```python
class SpeechToText:
    def __init__(self, service_provider: str, api_key: str):
        """Initialize STT service"""
        pass
    
    def transcribe_real_time(self, audio_stream) -> str:
        """Real-time transcription from audio stream"""
        pass
    
    def transcribe_file(self, audio_file: str) -> str:
        """Transcribe audio file"""
        pass
    
    def set_language(self, language_code: str) -> None:
        """Set recognition language"""
        pass
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- Audio preprocessing to reduce processing time
- Silence detection to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Local preprocessing before cloud recognition
- Usage tracking and optimization

## Technical Considerations
- Audio format compatibility
- Latency requirements for real-time chat
- Error handling and fallback options
- Integration with conversation management
