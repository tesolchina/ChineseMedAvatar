# Chinese Medicine Avatar Development Plan

## Overview
We'll develop an audio avatar system to help Chinese medicine students practice spoken English in clinical contexts. The avatar will simulate various healthcare communication scenarios using established medical communication frameworks.

## Key Communication Themes & Frameworks

Based on Ellie's comprehensive requirements, we'll implement seven core themes:

### Theme 2: Conducting Clinical Interviews with Patients
- **Framework**: Calgary-Cambridge Guide to Medical Interview - Communication Process
- **Focus**: Overall clinical interview framework and structure
- **Resources**: Sample dialogues and communication guidelines provided

### Theme 4: Communicating Key Chinese Medicine Concepts in English
- **Framework**: Calgary-Cambridge Guide (items 33-46)
- **Focus**: Translating TCM concepts effectively for English-speaking patients
- **Resources**: WHO international standard terminologies on TCM

### Theme 5: Explaining Treatment Plans and Procedures
- **Framework**: Calgary-Cambridge Guide (items 47-52)
- **Focus**: Clear communication of TCM treatment approaches
- **Integration**: Traditional Chinese medicine procedures with modern communication standards

### Theme 6: Handling Difficult Conversations
- **Framework**: SPIKES protocol
- **Focus**: Managing challenging patient interactions and sensitive topics
- **Skills**: De-escalation, empathy, and professional communication

### Theme 7: Referring Patients to Other Specialists
- **Framework**: IMIST-AMBO framework for patient handover
- **Focus**: Structured clinical handover and referral communication
- **Reference**: [St John Ambulance Clinical Handover Guidelines](https://clinical.stjohnwa.com.au/clinical-practice-guidelines/general/clinical-handover)

## Technical Infrastructure

### Avatar Platform
- **API**: HeyGen API for audio avatar generation
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini (recommended for response time optimization)
- **Alternative Models**: Testing different base models for optimal performance

### Learning Management System
- **Platform**: Bytewise with teacher accounts
- **Features**: 
  - Student-avatar interaction recording
  - Performance analysis and feedback
  - Progress tracking
  - Conversation practice scenarios

### Recording & Assessment
- **Chat History**: Full conversation logging between students and avatars
- **Teacher Analytics**: Detailed interaction analysis for performance review
- **Feedback Loop**: Structured assessment of student communication skills

## Educational Resources Integration

### WHO TCM Terminology
- **Resource**: [WHO International Standard Terminologies on Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240042322)
- **Application**: Standardized terminology for avatar knowledge base
- **Purpose**: Ensure accurate TCM concept communication in English

### Communication Frameworks
- **Calgary-Cambridge Guide**: Complete medical interview structure
- **SPIKES Protocol**: Difficult conversation management
- **IMIST-AMBO**: Systematic patient handover format

### Sample Materials
- **Dialogues**: Theme-specific conversation examples
- **Language Resources**: Structured vocabulary and phrase collections
- **Practice Cases**: Real-world scenario simulations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Platform Setup
- Configure Bytewise teacher accounts
- Integrate HeyGen API with GPT-4o-mini
- Test basic avatar functionality

### Phase 2: Content Development
- Develop system prompts for each communication theme
- Create scenario-based conversation templates
- Integrate WHO TCM terminology database

### Phase 3: Student Testing
- Deploy pilot testing with select students
- Gather feedback on avatar interactions
- Refine conversation flows and assessment criteria

### Phase 4: Full Deployment
- Launch comprehensive student access
- Teacher training on analytics platform
- Ongoing performance monitoring and optimization

## Learning Objectives

Students will develop:
1. **Clinical Interview Skills**: Structured patient communication using Calgary-Cambridge framework
2. **TCM Communication**: Effective English explanation of Chinese medicine concepts
3. **Treatment Planning**: Clear articulation of TCM treatment approaches
4. **Difficult Conversations**: Professional handling of challenging patient interactions
5. **Professional Handover**: Systematic patient referral and information transfer

## Success Metrics
- Student engagement with avatar conversations
- Improvement in communication assessment scores
- Teacher feedback on student performance analysis
- Conversation quality and clinical accuracy metrics
