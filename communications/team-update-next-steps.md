Subject: Chinese Medicine Avatar Project - Next Steps and Integration Strategy

Dear Team,

Following our analysis of the existing materials and the current live system at lessons.hkbu.tech, I wanted to share our progress and outline the next strategic steps for the Chinese Medicine Avatar project.

## Current Progress Summary

**✅ Completed:**
- Repository structure established with iframe-based architecture
- Four specialized avatar configurations created:
  - Dr. Li Wei (Diagnostic Specialist)
  - Master Chen (Traditional TCM Practitioner) 
  - Dr. Zhang (Acupuncture Specialist)
  - **NEW: Dr. Sarah Chen (Medical Communication Specialist)**
- HTML interface with responsive design and avatar selection
- Contact management system populated with team details
- Integration documentation for iframe embedding

**✅ Materials Extracted from Email Archive:**
- Google Docs reference for video generation module
- Existing HTML demo at gamesbe.asia:3000/GamePlay/Clinical_handover
- System prompts from current SimulateAnnotateChat bot
- Login credentials for chat.hkbu.life avatar management
- Technical requirements and framework specifications

## Baseline Analysis: Current Live System

The existing system at lessons.hkbu.tech demonstrates several key features:
- **ISBAR Framework focus** (Introduction, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
- **Three learning modes:** Interactive Learning, Avatar Tutor, Live Avatar Practice
- **Structured case scenarios:** Emergency Transfer, Routine Handover, Consultation Request
- **Progressive knowledge checks** with validation before practice
- **Clear communication guidelines** with visual do's and don'ts

## Strategic Next Steps

### Phase 1: Framework Integration (This Week)
1. **Enhance Dr. Sarah Chen bot** with all four communication frameworks:
   - ISBAR (newly integrated from baseline analysis)
   - Calgary-Cambridge (from our original requirements)
   - SPIKES (for difficult conversations)
   - IMIST-AMBO (for clinical handover)

2. **Create assessment modules** based on the live system's knowledge check pattern
3. **Develop Chinese Medicine specific scenarios** using their case structure

### Phase 2: Content Development (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Access extracted resources:**
   - Review Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mNAs7Qmqxvd0YpQC1pzEExQemS7ohOx9pCpuzsbgouU/edit
   - Test existing demo: https://gamesbe.asia:3000/GamePlay/Clinical_handover
   - Login to chat.hkbu.life to examine current configurations

2. **Create comprehensive scenario library:**
   - Emergency situations requiring urgent TCM consultation
   - Routine patient interviews about TCM treatments
   - Difficult conversations about treatment limitations
   - Cross-cultural communication challenges

### Phase 3: Technical Integration (Following 2 Weeks)
1. **GitHub repository setup and synchronization**
2. **Iframe integration testing** with technical backend
3. **Transcript analysis system** implementation
4. **Progressive assessment workflow** development

## Immediate Action Items

**For Kaitai & Andy (Technical Team):**
- Test the new Dr. Sarah Chen communication bot configuration
- Review iframe integration documentation in `/integration/`
- Begin development of the four priority features from August requirements

**For TDG Pedagogical Team:**
- Review the extracted materials in `/docs/extracted-materials.md`
- Provide feedback on Dr. Sarah Chen's communication framework coverage
- Develop Chinese Medicine specific case scenarios based on baseline analysis

**For All Team Members:**
- Access the existing demo system to understand current capabilities
- Review baseline analysis document for integration opportunities
- Prepare for framework consolidation discussions

## Key Questions for Discussion

1. Should we prioritize ISBAR integration given its use in the live system?
2. How can we best adapt Western communication frameworks for Chinese Medicine contexts?
3. What additional scenarios do we need beyond the baseline system's three case types?
4. How should we structure the progressive learning path from knowledge checks to avatar practice?

## Resources Created

All materials are now organized in our project repository:
- `/docs/extracted-materials.md` - Complete findings from email analysis
- `/docs/baseline-analysis.md` - Live system comparison and recommendations
- `/bot-config/dr-sarah-chen-communication.json` - New communication specialist avatar
- `/ui/index.html` - Ready-to-deploy interface with all four avatars

I believe we're well-positioned to move forward with a comprehensive solution that builds on both our original vision and the proven patterns from the existing system.

Please review these materials and let me know your thoughts on the proposed phasing and priorities. I'd like to schedule a team meeting this week to finalize our integration strategy.

Best regards,
Simon H WANG
