### Executive Summary (2-minute pitch)
"The Chinese Medicine Avatar project creates an interactive AI healthcare assistant that combines traditional Chinese medicine knowledge with cutting-edge avatar technology. Users can have natural conversations with specialized TCM practitioners through voice or text, receiving personalized guidance on health and wellness. Our September 2025 goals include animated photo avatars, cost-effective speech processing, and multi-avatar conversations."

### Technical Overview (5-minute explanation)
"Our architecture separates concerns between UI/UX design and technical implementation. The HTML interface provides user controls and avatar selection, while a separate technical repository handles the complex avatar animation, speech processing, and AI. Communication happens through secure iframe embedding and postMessage APIs. This approach allows rapid UI iteration while maintaining robust technical performance."
