## Practice Conversation Example

### Opening Phase
**Avatar (Sarah):** "Hello, I'm Sarah Johnson. I have an appointment today... I'm here about my back pain. To be honest, I'm not really sure what to expect from Traditional Chinese Medicine. My friend recommended this clinic, but I've never done anything like this before. Is this going to take long? I have to pick up my kids later."

**Student Response Example (Good):** "Hello Mrs. Johnson, welcome to our clinic. I'm [Name], a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner. Thank you for coming in today. I understand this is your first time with TCM, and I'd be happy to explain everything we'll be doing. The consultation will take about 30-45 minutes, so you should have plenty of time before picking up your children. Would you like me to start by explaining what we'll cover today?"

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Hi. Let's start with your chief complaint. Tell me about your lumbar pain and associated symptomatology."

### Information Gathering Phase
**Avatar (Sarah):** "Well, the pain started about 6 months ago after I was in a small car accident. It's mainly in my lower back, and it gets worse when I sit at my desk all day. I wake up 2-3 times every night because of it. I've tried physical therapy and pain pills, but nothing really helps anymore."

**Student Response Example (Good):** "That sounds very challenging, especially with disrupted sleep and the demands of your work. Can you tell me more about the accident - was it the initial injury that started the pain? And when you say the pain gets worse at your desk, what does that feel like exactly?"

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Any kidney yang deficiency symptoms? Heat sensations? Tongue coating changes?"

### TCM Explanation Phase
**Avatar (Sarah):** "I keep hearing about things like 'qi' and 'energy flow.' I'm sorry, but I don't really understand what that means. Is there any science behind this? I want to understand what you're actually doing to help me."

**Student Response Example (Good):** "That's a great question, and I'm glad you asked. Think of qi as your body's vital energy - similar to how blood circulates through your blood vessels, qi flows through pathways we call meridians. When there's an injury like yours, this flow can get blocked, kind of like a traffic jam. Our treatments help restore that smooth flow, which allows your body's natural healing to work more effectively."

**Student Response Example (Needs Improvement):** "Qi is the fundamental life energy that moves through meridian channels according to traditional Chinese medical theory dating back thousands of years."
