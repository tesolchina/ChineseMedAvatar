# Text-to-Speech Module

## Overview
Cost-effective text-to-speech engine for the Chinese Medicine Avatar project.

## Requirements
- Low API costs
- High quality Chinese language support
- Real-time processing capability
- Multiple voice options

## Potential Services
1. **Azure Cognitive Services Speech** - Competitive pricing for Chinese TTS
2. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** - Good Chinese language support
3. **Amazon Polly** - Pay-per-use model
4. **Local TTS Solutions** - One-time cost, no API fees

## API Interface
```python
class TextToSpeech:
    def __init__(self, service_provider: str, api_key: str):
        """Initialize TTS service"""
        pass
    
    def synthesize(self, text: str, language: str = "zh-CN") -> bytes:
        """Convert text to speech audio"""
        pass
    
    def set_voice(self, voice_id: str) -> None:
        """Set voice for synthesis"""
        pass
    
    def get_available_voices(self) -> list:
        """Get list of available voices"""
        pass
```

## Cost Optimization
- Batch processing for multiple requests
- Audio caching for repeated phrases
- Quality vs cost trade-offs
- Usage monitoring and alerts

## Integration Points
- Avatar animation sync
- Real-time conversation flow
- Audio output management
